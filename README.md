## Solution Description

A responsive landing page built using **HTML**, **vanilla CSS**, and **JavaScript** for the mobile navigation bar functionality.
I used a **linear-gradient** to create the overflow effect on the hero image.
The idea came from [Kevin Powell's YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb9s0iBE3ak), *"Easily Create Overlapping Sections on a Website."*
I also made slight adjustments to his approach to fit the design and layout of this specific challenge.
