## Solution Description
A responsive landing page built using HTML, vanilla CSS, and vanilla JavaScript for the mobile navigation.

### Learnings
- I used a **linear-gradient** to create the overflow effect on the hero image. The idea came from [Kevin Powell's YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb9s0iBE3ak), _"Easily Create Overlapping Sections on a Website."_

### Challenges
- Adding the background images and making them responsive across different screen sizes. I think the design turned out well, but Iâ€™ll continue exploring how to use background images more efficiently.
